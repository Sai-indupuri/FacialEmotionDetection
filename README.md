# Facial Emotion Detection 

This repository contains code for an emotion classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project involves training a model to classify facial expressions into seven categories and using this model for real-time emotion detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset)

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main scripts:

1. `EmotionClassificatoin.py`: This script handles data preparation, model building, and training.
2. `main.py`: This script handles real-time emotion detection using the trained model and OpenCV for face detection.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- keras
- tensorflow
- opencv-python

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn keras tensorflow opencv-python
